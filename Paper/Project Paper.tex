\section{Background/Motivation}

\par The primary question this paper seeks to answer is determining the sorts of models that accurately match the chemical reactions that yeast undergo within bread. Yeast interacts in complicated ways with the other ingredients in bread, and even with its own byproducts. We also want to verify if existing SIR and other pandemic models can accurately mimic the spread of yeast, and if not, what factors make these models no longer accurate. Determining the optimal initial conditions (quantities of yeast, water, etc.) and how these affect the growth is a secondary focus of this paper.

All figures should have a complete caption that helps the reader make sense of the figure even if they haven't read the paper yet. Here is an example: This figure shows the risk or mean squared error (in black) of for a generic family of regression models as a function of model complexity (the number of free parameters in the model).  The generalized aliasing decomposition shows that the risk is the sum of three parts: Model insufficiency (red), Data insufficiency (green), and Aliasing (blue).  Model insufficiency is monotonically decreasing as a function of complexity, Data insufficiency vanishes when the number of parameters is less than the number of training points (the classical regime), but increases monotonically in the modern regime (where the number of parameters is greater than the number of data points).  Aliasing generally increases up to the interpolation threshold and decreases thereafter, converging to zero almost surely as the number of parameters goes to infinity.

\subsection*{The Chemistry of Bread}
\;
\par There are four primary ingredients in bread dough: flour, water, salt, and yeast. Flour provides not only the gluten that gives bread its structure, but also contains sugars that the yeast consumes. Salt strengthens the bread dough, making it more elastic.

\par Once water is mixed with flour, enzymes from the flour activate, including alpha-amylase and beta-amylase. These enzymes break up the long starch chains in the flour, quickly converting these into glucose and maltose. These sugars, unlike starch itself, are edible by yeast. \cite{bread_chemistry_1}

\par Yeast is a type of single-celled fungus that produces the \ce{CO_2} that forms bubbles in bread. This process is called fermentation, and yeast undergoes two primary phases within bread. The first is aerobic respiration, where yeast consumes oxygen and sugar and produces carbon dioxide and ATP, which is a molecule that stores energy for cells.
\[
\ce{6O_2} + \ce{C_6H_{12}O_6} \to \ce{6CO_2} + \ce{6H_2O} + \ce{ATP}.
\]

\par In the second phase, called anaerobic respiration, occurs once the oxygen in the bread is exhausted. Yeast consumes glucose and begins producing ethanol instead of water as a biproduct. The amount of ethanol produces is very minimal compared to alcohol fermentation, and evaporates during the baking process. The yeast still produces \ce{CO_2} as a byproduct, but it produces it at a slower rate.
\[
\ce{C_6H_{12}O_6} \to \ce{2CO_2} + \ce{2C_2H_5OH} + \ce{ATP}. \text{\cite{bread_chemistry_2}}
\]
\cite{bread_chemistry_2}

\par Some of the more advanced models in this paper sought to incorporate this two-phase structure.

\par \textbf{WE NEED TO MENTION THE MODELS / TECHNIQUES THAT WERE USED BEFORE US TO MODEL THIS PROBLEM}


%% Second Section 
\section{Modeling}

The primary aspect of the project is the modeling of the chosen phenomenon. If your group's repeated attempts resulted in abject failure, or your group succeeded, detail them in this section. Be sure to account for the various attempted models and why they were not appropriate. Include numerical simulations for each attempted model. Reference figures and plots, like Figure~\ref{fig:MeanSquaredError}.

\subsection*{Simple Compartmental Model}

\par The goal of the first model is to get a baseline for 

We also hope that the model is physically accurate, in that the amount of yeast and byproducts increase over time while the amount of sugar decreases. For this model we used a simple compartmental model with sugar, yeast, and byproducts as our three compartments. The model's differential equation is given by
\begin{align*}
    \dot S &= -\alpha S Y\\
    \dot Y &= \beta S Y - \gamma Y\\
    \dot B &= \delta S Y,
\end{align*}
where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$ are constants. In particular, $\alpha$ controls the quantity of sugar eaten by yeast in each interaction, $\beta$ controls the reproduction rate of yeast as it consumes sugar, $\gamma$ controls the death rate of yeast, and $\delta$ controls the rate at which byproducts are produced as yeast consumes sugar.

\par Due to the simplicity of this model, we did not attempt to justify the constants through physical explanations.

\subsection*{Compartmental Model with Monod Equation}
We now seek to incorporate the Monod equation into a compartmental model. The Monod equation models the growth of a microorganism based on the concentration of a limiting substance. \cite{monod_1} The standard form of the Monod equation is given by 
\[
    \mu = \mu_{\text{max}} \frac{S}{K_s + S},
\]
where $\mu$ is the growth rate of a microorganism, $\mu_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum growth rate of the microorganism, $S$ is the concentration of the limiting substance for growth, and $K_s$ is the ``half-velocity'' constant (the value of $S$ when $\mu / \mu_{\text{max}} = 0.5)$. \cite{monod_2}

Some modifications to a traditional SIR model were required in order to fit the Monod equation into a compartmental model. SIR models typically assume a closed population, but for modeling yeast fermentation, compartments don't simply flow into one another as some mass escapes the system. 
Similarly, the yeast growth and fermentation are based on growth rates and yield coefficients, not just population flow. Let $Y$ depict the quantity of yeast, $S$ denote the quantity of sugar, and $P$ denote the byproducts produced (e.g. ethanol and $\ce{CO_2}$). The monod categorical model is given by 
\begin{align*}
    \dot{Y} &= \mu_{\text{max}} \frac{S}{K_s + S}Y \\
    \dot{S} &= -\frac{1}{Y_{X/S}} \dot{Y} \\
    \dot{P} &= Y_{P/S} (-\dot{S}),
\end{align*}
where $Y_{X/S}$ denotes the grams of biomass of yeast per gram of sugar, and $Y_{P/S}$ denotes the product yield of yeast per gram of sugar. Plotting for $t \in [0, 10]$, the plot of the solution is given by 
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{monod_categorical.png}
\end{center}
We use the initial conditions $(Y_0, S_0, P_0) = (0.1, 10, 0)$ (each with units g/L). We also suppose that $K_s = 0.6$, $Y_{X/S} = 0.1$, and $Y_{P/S} = 1$.

%% Third Section
\section{Results}

Clearly and succinctly state and describe the conclusions that you can draw from the model you have achieved (or the many failed attempts). Does your model(s) perform well quantitatively or qualitatively?

%%Fourth Section
\section{Analysis/Conclusions}

Discuss the appropriateness of the techniques/methods you employed in modeling. Did your group appropriately model the chosen phenomenon? If not, what different steps could you have taken if you had more time? What did you learn about the techniques/method that were used in the group project? If your model was successful, what additional insight/conclusions could you obtain from it? For instance, if you had a successfully modified SIR model, how might it affect different government policy? If you had a successful model for the spread of inaccurate information on social media, how might it be implemented to help reduce the spread of inaccurate information?
