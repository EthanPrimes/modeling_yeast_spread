Everyone:
- Look for datasets

Ethan:
- Write paper sections
- Get paper setup
- Fill out details in model

Connor:
- Send email asking for data from paper
- Write paper sections
- Ensure that we can commit / edit paper together

Jackson:
- Write paper sections
- Find ideal constants, find cool but bad examples

Paper:
- Analysis - look for ideal starting points

Ideas:
- Try a model where we let the sugar form then add the yeast later
- We should emphasize the "instability" of bread and its difficulty for different environments/starting points. I think that would help with the more critical feedback we received.
